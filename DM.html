        <h1> Interpretation of different blood glucose levels</h1>
        <li>Normal blood glucose/sugar level:Fasting blood sugar:3.9 to 5.5mmol/L() or 70 to 99 mg/dL </li>
        <li>Prediabetes condition: when Fasting blood glucoe level between 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L(110-125mg/dL) or Random blood glucose between 7.9 to 11 mmol/L(140 to 200mg/dL)</li>
        <li>Diabete:when Fasting blood glucose 7mmol/L(126 mg/dL ) or more and Random blood glucose 11.1 mmol/L(200mg/dL) or more</li>
        <li> ##Hypoglycemia (who suffering from diabetes)blood glucose level below 3.9mmol/L ( below 70mg/dL)</li>
        <li>## Hypoglycemia (who are not suffering from diabete) blood glucoe level below 3mmol/L(below 55mg/dL)</li>

        <h3> Some informations about prediabetes:</h3>
        <ul><
    <li>Prediabetes is a component of metabolic syndrome and is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that fall below the threshold to diagnose diabetes mellitus. It usually does not cause symptoms but people with prediabetes often have obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.[1] It is also associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prediabetes is more accurately considered an early stage of diabetes as health complications associated with type 2 diabetes often occur before the diagnosis of diabetes.</li>

      <li> Prediabetes can be diagnosed by measuring hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, or glucose tolerance test. Many people may be diagnosed through routine screening tests. The primary treatment approach includes lifestyle changes such as exercise and dietary adjustments. Some medications can be used to reduce the risks associated with prediabetes. There is a high rate of progression to type 2 diabetes but not everyone with prediabetes develops type 2 diabetes.[2] Prediabetes can be a reversible condition with lifestyle changes.
        
       <li> For many people, prediabetes and diabetes are diagnosed through a routine screening at a check-up. The earlier prediabetes is diagnosed, the more likely an intervention will be successful</li>>
